# Syncronous & Asyncronous Javascript (MVP)

1. What are promises and how they are useful?

A promise is an object that represents an action that hasn't finished yet, but will be at some point. It is like a placeholder result for an asynchronous operation

Promises are useful for:
i. They are better at handling asynchronous operations
ii. They improve code readablity
iii. They are better at handling errors

2. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code in JavaScript?

Synchronous JavaScript waits for one action to complete before moving to the next action, while
Asynchronoue JavaScript defers an operation by passing out a request into a seperate thread in order to free up the thread and move to other things.

3. Write out any sample syncronous and asyncronous javascript code
check async.js

4. List the different ways to deal with Asynchronous Code?

i. Callbacks
ii. Promises
iii. Async and await
iv. Generators
